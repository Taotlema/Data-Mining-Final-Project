Using a range of algorithms and machine learning to uncover patterns, trends, and useful information from data. Oftentimes applying these systems to specific senarios involing finance, commerce or transits; fields which greatly benefit from data analysis. As we embark creating on one last course application we've delegated to uncover as much meaningful insight from domestic commodity exhanges across the United States.
